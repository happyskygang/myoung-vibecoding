[WORKFLOW]
1) First, scan the repo and list the exact files you will touch.
2) Propose a short plan (max 10 bullets) mapped to acceptance criteria.
3) Implement in small commits (explain commit boundaries; do not actually git push).
4) Run: lint, typecheck, tests (if present), and build. Include command outputs or summarize failures precisely.
5) Provide a final summary: what changed, how to verify, and rollback notes.
